# 5/3/1 Workout Generator

**Focus on lifting.**

This tool automates the planning for Jim Wendler's famous 5/3/1 strength training program. Instead of wrestling with spreadsheets or calculating percentages at the gym, this generator creates a complete, personalized 6-month workout plan in seconds.

## What it does

The 5/3/1 program is one of the most effective strength building routines, but the math for training maxes, cycles, and deloads can be tedious. This generator handles all of that for you.

Simply enter your current lifts, and the tool builds a progression plan that includes:
- **Warmup Sets**: Properly calculated to prepare you for heavy work.
- **Main Lifts**: The core 5/3/1 progression (Squat, Bench, Deadlift, Overhead Press).
- **Assistance Work**: Customizable accessory exercises to build muscle and prevent imbalances.
- **Deload Weeks**: Strategically placed recovery weeks to keep you progressing long-term.
- **Progression**: Automatic weight increases after every 4-week cycle.

## Features

- **Instant PDF Export**: Generate a clean, printable workout log formatted perfectly for your clipboard.
- **6-Month Roadmap**: See your long-term progression with a single click.
- **Smart Rounding**: All weights are rounded to standard gym plate intervals.
- **Assistance Customization**: Choose your preferred accessory lifts (e.g., Pull-ups, Dips, Leg Press).

## How to Use

1. **Enter Your Numbers**: Input your current "One Rep Max" (1RM) for the four main lifts.
2. **Customize**: Select your preferred assistance exercises for each day.
3. **Generate**: Click the button to view your program.
4. **Print**: Download the PDF, print it out, and take it to the gym.

## Why 5/3/1?

The 5/3/1 philosophy is built on slow, steady progress. By starting light (using a "Training Max") and gradually increasing the weight, you avoid plateaus and build sustainable strength. This tool strictly follows those principles so you don't have to guess.
